## Post Content

```
Achieved 95%+ GPU utilization on NVIDIA H100 with 3 GPU-first prototypes.

Ecosystem compatibility proof: all run together, zero conflicts.
Reproducible benchmarks: JSON artifacts with NVML metrics.
cuQuantum integration: Team3 demonstrates real cuQuantum usage.

## Visual

**Screenshot to include:**
- Benchmark results table from README (Key Results section)
- Or: nvidia-smi output showing GPU utilization
- Or: Architecture diagram showing ecosystem compatibility

**Format:**
- High contrast (readable on mobile)
- One key metric highlighted (95% GPU util)
- Clean, technical (not marketing graphics)

---

## Hashtags

**Use sparingly (2-3 max):**
- #CUDA
- #NVIDIA
- #GPU

**Optional (if relevant):**
- #QuantumComputing (if cuQuantum focus)
- #OpenSource (if emphasizing open source)

**Don't overdo it** — Keep it clean, technical

---

## Timing

**Post at:** 21:00 Europe (same day as GitHub Release)

**Why:**
- Morning USA (9-10 AM EST) — Engineers check X in the morning
- West Coast (6-7 AM PST) — NVIDIA engineers see it early
- Maximum visibility window

---

## Engagement Strategy

**Monitor for 24h:**
- Reply to technical questions (show expertise)
- Ignore hype comments (don't feed noise)
- Tag relevant accounts only if genuinely relevant

**If NVIDIA engineer retweets:**
- Reply thoughtfully
- Share technical details
- Don't over-engage

**If post gets traction:**
- One follow-up max (if needed)
- Don't spam
- Wait for next release

## Alternative Shorter Version

**If character limit is tight:**

```
95%+ GPU utilization on NVIDIA H100.

3 prototypes, zero conflicts, reproducible benchmarks.
cuQuantum integration demonstrated.

```

**Character count:** ~150 (more room for engagement)

## Success Metrics

**Track:**
- Impressions (target: 1K+)
- Engagement rate (target: 3-5%)
- GitHub clicks (target: 20+)
- NVIDIA engineer engagement (retweets/comments)

**Decision:**
- If <100 impressions → Adjust timing/format for next release
- If 1K+ impressions → Good reach, continue strategy
- If 10K+ impressions → Viral potential, maximize engagement
